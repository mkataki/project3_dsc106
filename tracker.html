            <h2>Project Writeup</h2>
            
            <h3>What have you done so far?</h3>
            <p>
                So far, we have developed a functional heart rate zone tracker that dynamically updates based on user input. 
                The page includes interactive elements such as a speed slider, gender selection, and age-based heart rate prediction.
                Additionally, we have implemented an animated Mario or Peach character that runs across the screen, with animation speed 
                adjusting smoothly to match the selected speed. We also created a structured layout where heart rate zones are visually 
                displayed, and each zone's description is dynamically revealed when highlighted. The interface has been designed to be 
                user-friendly, ensuring that all components are well-organized and intuitive to interact with. 
                Also, we have ensured that the heart rate calculation logic follows a scientific approach, using age and speed to 
                estimate maximum heart rate effectively. Overall, the project integrates both data-driven decision-making and interactive 
                Uwe elements to make the experience engaging.
            </p>
    
            <h3>What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and why?</h3>
            <p>
                The most challenging part of the project will be ensuring smooth, real-time interactivity between all elements while 
                maintaining a visually appealing layout. One major difficulty is keeping the animation smooth when adjusting speed, 
                as reapplying animations can cause the character to restart instead of continuing naturally. Another challenge is 
                ensuring that all UI elements scale properly across different screen sizes and devices, requiring responsive 
                design techniques. Additionally, integrating real-time data visualization for heart rate tracking could be complex, 
                as it would require dynamically updating charts based on user input. Ensuring accurate heart rate calculations 
                that consider multiple factors, including gender differences and intensity levels, will also be critical. Lastly, 
                refining the user experience by adding better feedback mechanisms, such as color transitions or visual cues when 
                heart rate zones change, will require careful design and testing. Overcoming these challenges will involve optimizing 
                JavaScript functions, refining CSS animations, and implementing efficient event handling strategies.
